# barkingham-palace

A prototype website for a busy Grooming Salon and Boarding Kennels

## Instructions to View the Website

Please follow the sections below to get setup and run the website.

### Check Node and NPM are Installed

It is worth checking that you have node and npm installed and the version that your
system is running. To check node is installed and the version you have, type:

`node -v`

and for npm type:

`npm -v`

This will output the version number of each program (`12.10.0` and `6.11.3` respectively at the time of writing).

### Clone the repo

To get things installed, fork the repo in GitHub. Then, clone it to your own computer. Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies set up. This should add everything that is needed to run the Barkingham Palace Website locally.

### Running the Website

Run `npm start` to start the server. You should be directed to the landing page of the website, and can experiment with the pages using the navbar etc from there.

> **Note:** The website should be running on localhost:9000
> which you can view in your browser

Please feel free to let me know what you think :)
